## About Me
Over the past decade, Andy Godoy has immersed himself in the dynamic world of the automotive industry. As a shop foreman/lead, Andy's innate problem-solving abilities have been honed through working on a diverse range of vehicles, from timeless classic cars dating back to the 1800s to the cutting-edge technology of electric vehicles. Tackling the intricacies of these automotive marvels has never been an easy task.

One of Andy's strengths lies in his collaborative approach. He actively engages with multidisciplinary teams, including field service engineers and the iOS software team, to tackle complex challenges together. By working side by side with these experts, Andy strives to identify and implement prompt and lasting solutions for any issues that may arise.

Driven by a passion for continuous growth and development, Andy made a significant commitment this year by embarking on a journey to learn coding. The intention behind this endeavor is to apply these newfound skills back in the automotive industry, further enhancing his ability to contribute and excel in his field.

With a wealth of experience, a penchant for problem-solving, and a dedicated pursuit of knowledge, Andy Godoy is poised to make a lasting impact in the automotive industry and beyond.
